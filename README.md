altoids
=======

Altoids is my personal server, where I host [eljojo.net](http://eljojo.net) and some small projects.

This is supposed to be run using Ansible 1.6.1 on a DigitalOcean Debian 7.0 x64 image.

## How to Use?

First, copy the ``hosts.example`` file into ``hosts`` and fill it up with your hosts.
